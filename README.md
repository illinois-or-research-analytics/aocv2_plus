This repo contains code relevant to the data that is described in Jakatdar et al. (2022), https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04842. 
The preprint, code, and documentation are actively being revised. 

The first version of this manuscript titled 'AOC; Assembling Overlapping Communities' was submitted to QSS on Aug 5, 2022.
On Aug 18, we discovered coding error in a for loop that affected the size and modularity calculations for 2 of 128 clusters
that were generated by AOC enhancement of IKC clusters. The error was corrected the same day. we decided to refactor the 
AOC code, regenerate all the results, and update the manuscript. This repo is a fork of 
illinois-or-research-analytics/spring_2022_research and contains all work relevant to refactoring and updating.
