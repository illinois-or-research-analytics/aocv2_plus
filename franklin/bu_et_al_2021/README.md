# Bu's Breadth/Depth and Independence/Dependence (BDID) Calculations

## Running the Pipeline
Currently, the pipeline is broken up into two main parts, each with their own folders in this directory.
1. The first step of the pipeline is collecting the traditional Bu BDID metrics. This is contained in the folder [`py_version`](py_version).
2. The second step of the pipeline is collecting the clustered BDID metrics. This is contained in the folder [`clustered_bdid`](clustered_bdid).
3. The third step of the pipeline is generating visualizations for the data. This step is optional and is contained in the folder [`clustered_bdid`](clustered_bdid) folder.
